# Propositional-Calculus
Propositional calculus is a system of symbolic logic.
Propositions are statements in propositional logic which are either true or false.
Propositions may contain boolean variables, the constants true and false, and the following logical connectives: negation (not), conjunction (and), disjunction (or), conditional (if), and biconditional (if and only if).
An argument in propositional calculus is a set of propositions called premises, which are given to be true, and a proposition called the conclusion, whose truth value is to be determined.
If the conclusion can be determined to be true as a result of the premises, the argument is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid. 

For my CSE 2500 (Discrete Math) honors project, I implemented a proposition parser and argument validity checker for propositional calculus.
I used the Python unittest library to test each part of my code and demonstrate its functionality.
